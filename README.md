# Flood Analysis-Google Earth Engine
In this repository, there are different scripts associated with flood analysis based on satellite radar images in Google Earth Engine Platform. 

### Flood analysis in Amazonas comparing Sentinel-1 with PALSAR

Is important to check the water classification under different satellite images, if you want to construct a Time-Series of inundation pattern in a specific area you need to apply different filters to improve the water classification.  [Here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/083915ef8e164d91a99c9bc7007cbc54) you can find a Script for temporary flood analysis in Amazonas comparing Sentinel-1 with PALSAR.

### Sentinel NDVI Analysis

NDVI is an important index for flood analysis. A Script for Sentinel NDVI and Area Under The Curve calculation in dry season and export each image by year is [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/562a404bf0173904f20d263423633a26)

### Landsat NDVI Analysis

Each pixel has different flood patterns, [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/a2dd3f2bcd70399d754761c87ef03c80) there is a script for constructing a Time-Series analysis for each pixel in a specific area using Landsat images.
